# ACTIVE HANDOFF - FOLDERA

## DON'T FORGET — read first, every boot

1. **Value is the only score.** Foldera exists to produce one act the user wouldn't have done. Green CI, audits, clean code, merged PRs are *hygiene* — not value. "Healthy but not producing value" = still failing. (Bible II-B; `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` #19.)
2. **Safe silence beats a fake card.** Never manufacture a verdict; quiet on weak evidence.
3. **No "done" without live product proof.** Build/tests/CI green is necessary, never sufficient.
4. **Don't make Brandon the router/tester/merger.** Encode the decision; bring the result + reasoning, not the question. (BRANDON.md.)
5. **The ONE value-blocker right now (owner-side):** run a single paid generation cycle and confirm a real gem clears the bar (gem-ranking #456 is live) instead of "nothing cleared the bar." Everything else is secondary to this.

Keep this cockpit short and value-first. Completed-issue history lives in `SESSION_HISTORY.md` + git, never here.

## Boot

1. Read this file. 2. Read the active issue. 3. Check issue #136 for recent INTERRUPT receipts.

## Active command gate

`ACTIVE_SEAM_STATE.json` is the machine-readable control plane. Between rungs, `active_issue: none` is the valid form; the owner names the next seam. Constraint everywhere: NO paid API calls — prove in the harness.

## Current slice:

Between rungs — no active seam. `active_issue: none`; the owner names the next seam. Recently merged: #431 soft `primaryOutcomeDeadline` inference (PR #473); #454 broadcast/recruiting-sender suppression at the entity admission gate. #445 Master Audit is COMPLETE below.

**Merged to main (through `8654637`):** Pass 0 inventory · Pass 1 RLS `PASS` · Pass 2 database `PASS` (+D-3) · Pass 3 cost `CONCERN` (extraction cap 4→0.25) · **Pass 4 backend/runtime `CONCERN` (#458)** · **Pass 5 AI/ML grounding `PASS` (#461)** · **Pass 6 FE perf/a11y `PASS` +3 tap-target fixes (#463)** · **Pass 7 FE design/UX `PASS`** · **Pass 8 trust/claims `PASS` (fixed false SSO/SCIM/SAML claim + gate-hardened)** · F-1 (CI-on-PRs) · gem-ranking floor #456 · lapsing-card hygiene #457 · **overdue-admission window #460 (60d for risk≥60)** · gem-surfacing revert #453 · **LESSONS_LEARNED #19 (value-is-the-only-score) #458.**

**Pass 4 (#458) detail:** fixed B-2 — the `morning-pipeline` orchestrator had no per-stage isolation, so a thrown stage (e.g. nightly sync) silently dropped `daily_brief` (the value stage) for the whole day; `invokeStage` now isolates each stage (fails safe). C-2 root-caused: ~74% of directives pay for a second full LLM call because the first fails validation → routed to **Pass 5 + paid validation**, not shipped blind. Record: `docs/backend/RUNTIME_CORRECTNESS.md`. Verdict CONCERN — runtime is *safe* but still costs without producing value.

**Pass 5 (AI/ML grounding) `PASS` (#461):** grounding chain is fail-closed — hard `no_evidence` rejection, `fabricated_claim` block, freshness penalizes recency (magic invariant), 37 tests green. O-5.1 `no_source_grounding` soft-by-design. C-2 first-pass-quality fix → owner paid wall. Record: `docs/backend/AI_GROUNDING_FAITHFULNESS.md`.

**Pass 6 (FE perf/a11y) `PASS` (#463):** verified live at 375px — no overflow, reduced-motion covers framer+CSS, focus rings, no-CLS images. Fixed 3 sub-44px tap targets in `LandingPage.tsx`. Record: `docs/frontend/PERF_A11Y_AUDIT.md`.

**Pass 7 (FE design/UX) `PASS`:** single dominant CTA, logo→home, all 9 routes resolve (no dead links), amber restrained (7×), no AI-cliché icons, one-click controls + evidence (recognition-over-recall). O-7.2 enterprise SSO/SCIM claims handed to Pass 8. Record: `docs/frontend/DESIGN_UX_AUDIT.md`.

**Pass 8 (trust/claims) `PASS` (fixed):** found a real false enterprise claim — "SSO / SCIM" / "SAML 2.0 ready" on landing + /pricing while NO SAML/SCIM/SSO exists (auth = Google + AzureAD OAuth only). Removed both, hardened `forbiddenClaimTerms` (SSO/SCIM, SCIM, SAML) so it can't regress. Other claims verified honest. Record: `docs/frontend/TRUST_HONEST_CLAIMS_AUDIT.md`.

**Pass 9 (Vercel deploy/config) `PASS`:** strict CSP + security headers on all routes, single morning-pipeline cron with `maxDuration` on all 4 pipeline routes, sensible redirects/caching, Sentry wired, no header duplication. Obs: O-9.1 legacy `/try` page+api shadowed by redirects (guarded cleanup task spawned), O-9.2 CSP allows unsafe-inline/eval (Next tradeoff), O-9.3 maxDuration=300 assumes Pro tier. Record: `docs/backend/VERCEL_DEPLOY_AUDIT.md`.

**Pass 10 (GitHub CI) `PASS`:** ci.yml on PRs (F-1), change-aware, draft-skip, ci-passed aggregator; ZERO `schedule:` crons (billing-safe). F-10.1 ground-truth correction: growth agents (`lib/agents/*`) are NOT deleted — they're quarantined default-OFF behind `areAgentsEnabled` (#231) + budget guard, reachable only via dispatch-only workflows; corrected the `project_growth_layer_deleted` memory. Owner item: branch protection on main still OFF. Record: `docs/backend/GITHUB_CI_AUDIT.md`.

**Pass 11 (observability) `PASS`:** structured logging hashes userId (no raw PII), Sentry wired (instrumentation.ts), durable tkg_actions receipts, scoring hot path proven metadata-only (egress tests green), no committed .env secrets. Obs: O-11.1 `details` is caller-sanitized not logger-sanitized (no leak found); O-11.2 stale local gitignored .env clutter. Record: `docs/backend/OBSERVABILITY_AUDIT.md`.

**Pass 12 (governance/memory meta) `PASS` — FINAL pass:** governance machinery sound (gate:continuity + per-seam contract + keep-list/anti-regrowth). Meta-fix applied: registered all 13 pass records in the keep-list ledger `docs/SOURCE_OF_TRUTH_MAP.md` (was the rediscovery gap — Passes 3–11 docs were unindexed); growth-layer memory corrected. **Master Audit #445 COMPLETE (passes 0–12).** Record: `docs/GOVERNANCE_MEMORY_AUDIT.md`.

## Next exact move

0. **Between rungs** — #431 (PR #473) and #454 (broadcast-sender suppression) both merged; owner names the next seam.
1. **Owner — the value lever (TRUE wall):** one paid generation cycle to confirm a real gem now surfaces. This is the *only* move that turns "healthy" into "valuable."
2. **Master Audit #445 is COMPLETE (passes 0–12 all merged).** No audit passes remain. The only open items are the owner paid wall (item 1) — C-2 first-pass validation quality + the value-lever generation cycle. Between-rungs after this merges; owner names the next seam.
3. **#454 broadcast/recruiting-sender suppression MERGED** — the entity admission gate now rejects junk/transactional + recruiting/automated senders (fail-safe; real human `julieta@micro1.io` preserved). Owner: confirm live that a real contact still surfaces.
4. Deferred follow-ups (harness-only): B-4 budget-reservation reconciliation; B-5 persist retry reasons (Pass 11); the two-way test for relationship gems (coupled to #454). [>30d-overdue admission window shipped via #460.]

Open owner items (not active seams): configure the free external guardian cron (code shipped); landing polish (standing — obviously better each pass, not incremental).

Current production truth: `Last known main SHA: 8654637` (#460 merged — gem-surfacing slices #456/#457/#460 all live). Master Audit #445 passes 0–4 + F-1 merged: RLS/security `PASS`, data-integrity `PASS`, cost `CONCERN`, runtime `CONCERN`. Guardian fires-grounded-and-pings-only-finished-work live (#391/#393/#394); owner self-review system live (`docs/BRANDON.md` + `docs/EXPERT_PANEL.md`).

Safety rails: no outbound sends by default; no paid tests without naming exact cost; acquisition quarantined OFF; no fake claims; one intervention max; safe silence is a win; schema only via committed+applied+verified migrations.

## Product doctrine

Foldera is a Workday Presence Layer: state + connectors + triggers + one intervention — remembers where the user was, decides when to interrupt, gives one next move, one click to respond, updates state, stays quiet otherwise. No dashboard / task-manager / inbox-summary / chatbot / surveillance drift. `FOLDERA_MASTER_BIBLE.md` carries doctrine; `AGENTS.md` is the agent contract.

## GitHub writeback contract

- GitHub writeback before stop is mandatory. GitHub source truth beats chat memory; if work isn't written to GitHub, the transaction is incomplete.
- Before stopping, post one terminal receipt: `PR OPENED`, `PROOF`, `MERGE READY`, `BLOCKED`, or `STOPPED`.
- Update `ACTIVE_HANDOFF.md` when the seam / proof / next move / blocker changes; `FOLDERA_BUILD_ORDER.yaml` when the active issue changes.
