# ACTIVE HANDOFF - FOLDERA

## TL;DR

- **Active seam #567 (parked, owner-gated):** waiting on `tkg_goals` re-ground + Gmail connector (1→967). No code work left on this seam.
- **This session (reliability sweep):** #577 boot memory pin; #578 Slack alert fires the instant an OAuth token fatally drops; #579 Graph subscription renewal wired into morning-pipeline (was the root cause of the "OneDrive isn't syncing" email — Microsoft subscriptions expire every 70h, renewal route existed but was never called).
- **Remaining owner action:** Google OAuth app not verified for sensitive scopes (Gmail) — submit for Google verification to stop periodic forced re-auth; pool hygiene (88/135 active dated commitments overdue 30d+) is the next code seam.

## DON'T FORGET — read first, every boot

1. **Value is the only score.** Foldera exists to produce one act the user wouldn't have done. Green CI, audits, clean code, merged PRs are *hygiene* — not value.
2. **Learning agentic life-system — proactive, instant, value-cascade. NOT an inbox/reply bot.** Reply-drafting is R2 (rung 2 of 6, reactive) — do NOT call it "the product". Foldera lurks/watches/learns the user's *own* world and ships the next real act they'd never have asked for — opportunity-finder, not CBT nag. Walk the cascade until something clears a real bar: **R1 advance what you started** (drafts/Drive/in-flight) → R2 owed replies → R3 inbound-ask→finished prep → R4 goal moves → R5 relationship → R6 outward Scout (sign-off-gated). **KEYSTONE = goal inference (`tkg_goals`): stale goals → engine can't climb → falls to homework reminders; refresh goals from recent activity is the lever.** Instant/event-driven, never fabricate to fill silence; a due-date nag is NOT an act. Vision: `FOLDERA_MASTER_BIBLE.md` Part II-A/II-B; owner taste: run `docs/BRANDON.md` §5 before claiming "is it good?".
3. **No "done" without live product proof.** Build/tests/CI green is necessary, never sufficient.
4. **Don't make Brandon the router/tester/merger.** Pick the highest-leverage move, do it end-to-end, bring the result + reasoning.
5. **Scout is additive and never auto-sends.** The Workday Presence Layer stays the always-on default; every `SCOUT_*` flag defaults off.
6. **The Guardian looks inward, not outward.** Watch the user's *own* world. A fixture/sample card must never be posted to a real channel as if real. See issues #492 / #494 / #481.
7. **Reduce friction by default, every session.** Standing owner directive: cut process friction and cruft proactively without re-asking. Hard safety rails still need sign-off. See `AGENTS.md` → "Friction Reduction — Standing Authorization".

Keep this cockpit short and value-first. Completed-issue history lives in `docs/archive/SESSION_HISTORY.md` + git, never here.

## SETTLED — do not relitigate

These are decided. Do not re-derive, re-probe, or re-propose the dead alternative.

1. **Delivery is push/event-driven, not a scheduled cron.** Provider push (Microsoft Graph change-notifications → `/api/webhooks/graph`; Gmail watch is phase 2) fires the card the instant data changes — the change is the clock. `deliverWorkdayPresence` (`lib/workday-presence/deliver-now.ts`) is the single seed→trigger pipeline ALL callers use. The `vercel.json` crons are a Hobby-throttled fallback heartbeat + subscription-renewer only; never "wait for the cron". Old `daily-brief-generate` RETIRED (#548). **Push architecture MERGED #555.**
2. **Owner = `2cbc1bab`.** `FOLDERA_SELF_USER_ID` is canonical owner resolution everywhere; `INGEST_USER_ID` is legacy fallback only (fixed in #553). Old account `e40b7cd8` is empty post-#509.
3. **`SAFE_SILENCE` is a valid SUCCESS.** Never loosen a gate to force a card.
4. **Live-pool schema + probes live in `docs/LIVE_POOL_PROBE.md`.** Don't re-derive columns or re-pull the pool to "see what the brain has" — it's already canned.
5. **Budget phantom cap fixed (#555).** `api_budget_check_and_reserve` reconciles to real `api_usage` ledger on every call (durable, not a one-time reset). Micro1 eval agent (`398a8c82` / `zz933@expert.micro1.ai`) permanently excluded via `isExcludedPipelineUser`.
6. **Card IS the act; pool self-cleans.** The card leads with the ready-to-send draft, not homework scaffolding (#556 `send_message`, #564 `write_document` acquisition). Past-due EVENT commitments auto-expire from candidacy at scorer load (#562/#537), overdue actions preserved. Don't reintroduce homework framing or per-row manual suppression.

## Boot

1. Read this file. 2. Read the active issue (#567). 3. Check issue #136 for recent INTERRUPT receipts.

## Active command gate

`ACTIVE_SEAM_STATE.json` is the machine-readable control plane.

Issue #567 is the active foundation seam.

Constraint everywhere: NO paid API calls and NO production mutation without explicit owner authorization — prove in the harness.

## Current slice:

**#567 — PR #568 MERGED. Code complete; parked on owner sign-offs.** (This session's side-quest #572/#573 merged: duplicate-card dedup cooldown + lapsing-nag retirement + stale Rule 59(e) suppression.)

- Issue #567 remains OPEN pending two owner actions; no Claude code work left.
- Owner sign-off: `tkg_goals` DB edit (re-ground apex goal) + Gmail connector fix (1→967).

## Next exact move

1. **Owner sign-off (#567):** `tkg_goals` re-ground + Gmail connector (1→967) → trigger `/api/cron/ingest-and-deliver`, verify R1 card via Probe 1.
2. **Pool-hygiene seam (next code seam):** auto-expire/suppress the 88 active commitments overdue 30d+ (generalize past-due expiry #562 beyond events).
3. **Google OAuth verification (owner-only):** submit app for Google verification — unverified app with Gmail sensitive scope is the remaining token-drop exposure.

## Product doctrine

Foldera is a Workday Presence Layer (the always-on default) plus, additively, a flag-gated Proactive Scout lane (Bible Part V). No dashboard / task-manager / inbox-summary / chatbot / surveillance drift; no auto-send. `FOLDERA_MASTER_BIBLE.md` carries doctrine; `AGENTS.md` is the agent contract.

## GitHub writeback contract

- GitHub writeback before stop is mandatory. GitHub source truth beats chat memory; if work isn't written to GitHub, the transaction is incomplete.
- Before stopping, post one terminal receipt: `PR OPENED`, `PROOF`, `MERGE READY`, `BLOCKED`, or `STOPPED`.
- Update `ACTIVE_HANDOFF.md` when the seam / proof / next move / blocker changes; `FOLDERA_BUILD_ORDER.yaml` when the active issue changes.
