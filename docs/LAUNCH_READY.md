```

## 🎯 PRE-LAUNCH CHECKLIST

NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://foldera.ai         # Production URL
```

### **2. Database Setup**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL editor:
-- File: supabase/migrations/20250130000000_billing_system.sql
-- Creates: subscriptions, usage_tracking, referrals tables
```

### **3. OAuth Configuration**

**Google Cloud Console:**
1. Enable APIs: Calendar, Gmail, Drive
2. Create OAuth consent screen
3. Add redirect URIs:
   - `https://foldera.ai/api/auth/google/callback`
   - `https://foldera.ai/api/auth/google/callback-instant-audit`
   - `https://foldera.ai/api/auth/google/calendar/callback`

**Stripe Dashboard:**
1. Create products: Pro ($49/mo), Team ($99/mo)
2. Set webhook: `https://foldera.ai/api/billing/webhook`
3. Enable events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.*`

## 🎬 THE DEMO FLOW

### **12-Second Magic**
```
1. Visit foldera.ai/connectors
2. Click "Connect Google Calendar"
3. Authorize (3 sec)
4. See conflicts detected (2 sec)
5. Click "Execute Reschedule" (1 sec)
6. Success notification (1 sec)
7. Calendar updated automatically
```

### **The Pitch**
```
"Watch this.

[Connect Google Calendar]

[Pause for analysis]

'You're double-booked at 2pm. Board meeting vs client call.'

See that green button? [Execute Reschedule]

[Click]

Done. Client moved to 4pm, email sent, team notified.

That's Foldera. Problems solved, not just detected.

Try it free: foldera.ai"

1. **Executable Actions**: Only tool that actually solves problems
2. **Cross-Source Intelligence**: Detects conflicts others can't see
3. **Trust Ladder**: Earns autonomy over time
4. **Value-Based Pricing**: Pay for solutions, not just insights
5. **Network Effects**: More connectors = more value

## 💡 THE VISION

**Foldera isn't just a productivity tool.**

It's the first AI system that actually solves problems instead of just finding them. Every other tool gives you MORE work. Foldera does the work FOR you.

Connect your tools → We find conflicts → Click to fix them.

That's it. That's the product.

**And it's ready to ship.** 🚀
