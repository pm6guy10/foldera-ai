You know that **dread** on Sunday night? That "What did I miss?" anxiety that steals your Sabbath?

**We killed it.**

## 🧠 The Pipeline (What Just Happened)

### 1. **THE BRAIN** (AI Conflict Detection)
- Ingested 3 signals: Calendar event, Slack message, Gmail
- GPT-4o analyzed them and detected **6 conflicts**
- Identified that Sarah's Slack message contradicts Monday's calendar event
- Found that the client email also conflicts with Sarah's message

**Processing time:** 4.5 seconds

### 2. **THE CORTEX** (Knowledge Graph)
- Saved all signals to `work_signals` table
- Stored **6 relationships** in `signal_relationships` table
- Created a **persistent memory** of conflicts
- Now queryable: "Show me everything that blocks Project Phoenix"

**Result:** A living knowledge graph that remembers conflicts

### 3. **THE NARRATOR** (Executive Briefing)
- Queried the Knowledge Graph for conflicts
- GPT-4o wrote an executive briefing
- Formatted as clean HTML email
- Subject: "⚡ Monday Briefing: 6 Conflicts"

**Output:** Actionable intelligence, not just data

### 4. **THE COURIER** (Email Delivery)
- Sent directly to your inbox
- Gmail API integration
- Message ID: `19aa9d1d8177be33`

**Result:** You wake up Monday with clarity, not chaos

```

- Patterns emerge over time
- "Show me everything related to Project Phoenix"

### 3. **The Sunday Night Cure**
The **dread is gone**:
- You know what's coming
- You're prepared
- You can rest

### 4. **Autonomous Chief of Staff**
It's not a chatbot. It's an **autonomous agent**:
