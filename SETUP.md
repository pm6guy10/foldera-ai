## 1. SUPABASE SETUP

Supabase is your database. You need two values: the URL and the service role key.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Open Supabase**
   - Go to: https://app.supabase.com
   - Log in with your account

2. **Select Your Project**
   - You should see your project (probably called "foldera" or similar)
   - Click on it to open

3. **Navigate to API Settings**
   - Look at the LEFT SIDEBAR
   - Click the ‚öôÔ∏è **Settings** icon (gear icon at the bottom)
   - In the settings menu, click **"API"**

4. **Copy Your Keys**
   - You'll see a section called "Project URL"
   - Copy the URL (looks like: `https://xxxxxxxxxxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - Open your `.env.local` file
   - Paste it after `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=`
   
   - Scroll down to "Project API keys"
   - Find the **"service_role"** key (NOT the "anon" key!)
   - Click the üëÅÔ∏è eye icon to reveal the key
   - Copy the entire key (it's LONG, starts with `eyJ...`)
   - Paste it after `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=`

### What It Should Look Like:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://abcdefghij.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFz...
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** The service_role key is SECRET. Never share it or commit it to GitHub!

‚úÖ **Done with Supabase!**

---

## 2. NEXTAUTH SECRET

NextAuth needs a random secret to encrypt session tokens. You need to generate a 32-character random string.

### Option A: Using Terminal (Mac/Linux/WSL)

1. Open your terminal
2. Copy and paste this command:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```
3. Press Enter
4. Copy the output (looks like random characters)
5. Paste it after `NEXTAUTH_SECRET=` in your `.env.local`

### Option B: Using Online Generator (Any OS)

1. Go to: https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32
2. Copy the generated string
3. Paste it after `NEXTAUTH_SECRET=` in your `.env.local`

### Option C: Manual Random String

If both above fail, just type a random string of letters, numbers, and symbols (at least 32 characters long).

### What It Should Look Like:
```bash
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=ABcd1234XYzw5678!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

The `NEXTAUTH_URL` is already filled in - don't change it for local development!

‚úÖ **Done with NextAuth!**

## 5. STRIPE

You already have these from your screenshot!

### Instructions:

1. Open your `.env.local` file
2. Find these three lines:
   ```bash
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_KEY
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_KEY
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_SECRET

## 6. RESEND EMAIL SETUP

Resend is the email service that sends meeting briefs to users.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Sign Up for Resend**
   - Go to: https://resend.com
   - Click "Sign Up" (top right)
   - Enter your email and create a password
   - Verify your email

   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Copy it NOW - you won't be able to see it again!
   - Paste it after `RESEND_API_KEY=` in your `.env.local`

4. **Use Test Email (For Now)**
   - The `.env.local` already has: `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev`
   - This is Resend's TEST email address
   - It works WITHOUT domain verification
   - Perfect for development!

### What It Should Look Like:
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_123456789_AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOp
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
RESEND_FROM_NAME=Foldera
```

### Later: Verify Your Own Domain (Optional)

Once you're ready for production:

1. Go to Resend Dashboard ‚Üí "Domains"
2. Click "+ Add Domain"
3. Enter: `foldera.ai`
4. Follow the DNS instructions to verify
5. Change `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=briefings@foldera.ai`

But for now, stick with `onboarding@resend.dev`!

‚úÖ **Done with Resend!**

## 7. FINAL VERIFICATION

Now let's make sure EVERYTHING is set up correctly!

### Checklist

Open your `.env.local` file and verify:

```
‚úÖ ALL VARIABLES HAVE VALUES (no empty ones)
‚úÖ NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL starts with https://
‚úÖ SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is a long string starting with eyJ
‚úÖ NEXTAUTH_SECRET is at least 32 characters
‚úÖ NEXTAUTH_URL is http://localhost:3000
‚úÖ GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID ends with .apps.googleusercontent.com
‚úÖ GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET starts with GOCSPX-
‚úÖ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY starts with sk-ant-api03-
‚úÖ STRIPE_SECRET_KEY starts with sk_test_
‚úÖ NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY starts with pk_test_
‚úÖ STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET starts with whsec_
‚úÖ RESEND_API_KEY starts with re_
```

### Test Your Setup

1. **Install Dependencies** (if you haven't already)
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open Your App**
   - Go to: http://localhost:3000
   - If it loads without errors, you're good! üéâ

4. **Check for Errors**
   - Look at your terminal for any error messages
   - If you see errors about missing environment variables, go back and check them

---

## 8. TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "Missing environment variable"

**Solution:**
1. Make sure the `.env.local` file is in the ROOT of your project (same folder as `package.json`)
2. Make sure there are NO SPACES before or after the `=` sign
3. Make sure each line is: `KEY=value` (not `KEY= value` or `KEY =value`)
4. Restart your dev server: Stop it (Ctrl+C) and run `npm run dev` again

### Problem: "Google OAuth redirect_uri_mismatch"

**Solution:**
1. Go back to Google Cloud Console ‚Üí Credentials
2. Click on your OAuth client
3. Double-check ALL THREE redirect URIs are EXACTLY:
   - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
   - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback`
   - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/calendar/callback`
4. Make sure there are no trailing slashes or extra characters
5. Save and wait 5 minutes for changes to propagate

### Problem: "Supabase connection failed"

**Solution:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API
2. Make sure you copied the **service_role** key, NOT the anon key
3. The service_role key is much longer
4. Copy it again and replace in `.env.local`

### Problem: "Stripe webhook signature verification failed"

**Solution:**
1. For local testing, you need Stripe CLI
2. Or you can test without webhooks initially
3. The webhook secret is only needed for handling payment events

### Problem: "Resend authentication failed"

**Solution:**
1. Go to Resend Dashboard ‚Üí API Keys
2. Make sure the key has "Sending access" permission
3. If you revealed the key more than once, create a NEW key
4. Delete the old key and use the new one

### Problem: "NextAuth session error"

**Solution:**
1. Delete your browser cookies for localhost:3000
2. Generate a new NEXTAUTH_SECRET:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```
3. Replace it in `.env.local`
4. Restart dev server

## üéâ CONGRATULATIONS!

If you made it through all the steps, your Foldera environment is fully configured!

### Next Steps:

1. **Test Authentication:**
   - Try signing in with Google
   - Make sure it connects your calendar

2. **Test Features:**
   - Upload a document
   - Create a case
   - Try the instant audit feature

3. **Monitor Logs:**
   - Keep an eye on your terminal for errors
   - Check Supabase logs for database issues
   - Check Resend logs for email delivery

## üîê SECURITY REMINDERS

- ‚ùå NEVER commit `.env.local` to git
- ‚ùå NEVER share your API keys publicly
- ‚ùå NEVER use test keys in production
- ‚úÖ The `.gitignore` already excludes `.env.local`
- ‚úÖ For production, set env variables in Vercel/hosting dashboard
- ‚úÖ Rotate keys regularly for security

**Happy Coding! üöÄ**
