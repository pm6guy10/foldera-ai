# Foldera — Claude context

Next.js 14 App Router · Supabase · Claude API
Single-user production app. Auth via NextAuth. Ingest user: `INGEST_USER_ID` env var.

---

## Stack notes
- App Router only — no Pages Router
- All DB access via `lib/supabase.ts` (server-side client)
- Directives live in `tkg_actions`, signals in `tkg_signals`, patterns in `tkg_patterns`, goals in `tkg_goals`
- `/api/conviction/latest` and `/api/graph/stats` are the two dashboard data routes
- Public onboard routes under `/api/onboard/*` use `tempUserId` (UUID), no session required

## Product logic — don't violate these
- Email is captured on the landing page. Never ask for it again inside the app.
- Never ask the user a question Foldera should be able to answer itself.
- Never add a step that requires user effort when the engine can generate instead.
- The product promise is zero lift. If a user has to think hard to get value, the feature is broken.
- Friction is a bug, not a design choice.
